Tasks for the Track New Activity in the home page
1. Add a new field to the "ActivityTypes" schema (defined in db-schema.md) that indicates how frequesnt this activity should be tracked.
For example: "Sleep" - should be tracked once a day. 
Meal should be tracked few times a day. 
Exercise can be tracked a few times day (but not every day).
We will use this field to know when to prompt the user to track this activity.
For example - for sleep, since its once a day, once a user tracked it, the app will no longer suggest it that day.
But for meals, since it can be tracked few times a day, the app will keep suggesting it to the user, same for exercise.
